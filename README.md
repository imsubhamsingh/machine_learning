# Machine_learning
lets get the hands dirty by implementing machine learning in just few lines of code
Part 1 - Hello World
Six lines of Python is all it takes to write your first machine learning program!
Part 2 - Loading And Testing datasets
we'll build one on a real dataset
Part 4 - Let’s Write a Pipeline
we’ll write a basic pipeline for supervised learning with just 12 lines of code. Along the way, we'll talk about training and testing data. Then, we’ll work on our intuition for what it means to “learn” from data.for example we have to classify in between a ham or a spam. We will deal such type sorts of things in this part
